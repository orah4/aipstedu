Ghana CoE ICT Pedagogy (Sample)
- Learning outcomes must align to teacher education curriculum.
- ICT integration should move beyond presentation to interactive learning.
- Offline/low-bandwidth alternatives: local LMS, offline content packs, local models.

TOPIC: Introduction to Computer Systems

DEFINITION:
A computer system is an electronic device that accepts data, processes it, stores it, and produces output.

COMPONENTS:
1. Hardware
   - Input devices (keyboard, mouse)
   - Output devices (monitor, printer)
   - Storage devices (HDD, SSD)

2. Software
   - System software (Operating System)
   - Application software (Word, Excel)

EXAMPLES:
- Desktop computer
- Laptop
- Smartphone

KEY POINTS:
- Hardware is physical
- Software is logical
- Both must work together






TOPIC: Evolution of Artificial Intelligence to Agentic AI

OVERVIEW:
Agentic AI represents the next evolution of artificial intelligence. It moves beyond reactive and passive systems into autonomous, goal-oriented systems capable of planning, acting, learning, and collaborating over time.

The evolutionary pathway of AI follows this progression:
Artificial Intelligence → Machine Learning → Neural Networks → Deep Learning → Generative AI → AI Agents → Agentic AI

- Long-term memory
- Task planning
- Task execution
- Tool usage
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Real-time feedback loops


SECTION 7: Agentic AI – True Autonomy

DEFINITION:
Agentic AI represents the most advanced layer of AI, focusing on autonomy, governance, safety, and long-term goal alignment.

KEY ELEMENTS:
